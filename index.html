            <h2 class="about-labels">Sporty Kittycat</h2>
            <p class="golf"> Mom loves playing Golf and chess during her spare times. For her, golf is a way to keep a life balance and interact with nature in a very challenging way: 
                hitting precisely that small ball without digging the soil. Her favorite part of the game is patting and driving the golf buggy.
            </p>
            <p class="chess">
                Aside from Golf, mom loves playing brainy games: Chess and Scrabble.
                During her younger years, she had always been a University Chess Varsity and was winning trophies in the local tournaments.
                <br>
                She also represented her country Philippines in the <a href="https://www.wespa.org/youth/img/Group.jpg">Scrabble World Championship </a> way back year 2011.

                <br>
                <br> She also loves cooking yummy dishes and baking yummy pies. 
                However, for cats she said I could not eat them coz it is not good for a cat's health, so she gives me yummy treats from Germany instead! I'm a happy Meow!
                <br>
                <br> Gardening of beautiful flowers is her thing as well. Here are our lovely roses during the Summer time. You can see in my Meow Gallery that I love biting her rose plants!
